# Time-series-analytics-course

This short course was designed as an introduction to using the Python ecosystem for generating insights from time series datasets. We provide particular attention to air-quality and meteorological datasets using 3 Jupyter notebooks. 


Time-series data and associated methods for generating insights is a huge area of research. We do not cover many methods here, rather provide a starting point from which a user could become comfortable with the general Python ecosystem whilst moving towards methods that include machine learning and detecting points of change.
