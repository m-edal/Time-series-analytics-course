    "\n",
    "In most areas of environmental science spatial data is pivotal for analysis and visualization; So much so that it is useful we briefly extend our geospatial learning to include more *formal* definitions of processes and data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you start to work more frequently with geospatial data, you will inevitably come across **Geographic Information Systems**, or more commonly referred to as **GIS**. GIS is a system used for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data related to positions on Earth's surface. It helps analysts understand patterns, relationships, and geographic context. In our course so far we have structured our learning around types of data storage and ways to create and access data. When we refer to GIS we might consider this a seperate field by itself. Indeed, there are multiple components of GIS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data**: The core of GIS, encompassing geographical (spatial) data and attribute (descriptive) data.\n",
    "- **Tools for Analysis**: GIS provides tools to analyze and interpret data, revealing patterns and relationships.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: Beyond maps, GIS allows for sophisticated visual representations like 3D models and thematic maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is this different from what we have looked at so far? GIS essentially is a system for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Layering Information**: GIS layers different types of data (like roads, rivers, population) to show relationships and patterns.\n",
    "- **Spatial Analysis**: It can perform complex spatial analyses, answering questions like \"What is the shortest route?\" or \"What areas are at high risk for flooding?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "GIS is often, and incorrectly, thought to remain a tool solely within the field of Geography. GIS is not just for geographers; it's used in history, archaeology, environmental science, engineering, and more. Many use dedicated GIS software products to perform the above. The most common include: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **ArcGIS**: Developed by Esri, ArcGIS is one of the most widely used GIS software tools globally. It offers a suite of professional GIS applications, including ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro, and various online tools. It's known for its extensive capabilities in data visualization, analysis, and management.\n",
    "- **QGIS (Quantum GIS)**: An open-source alternative to ArcGIS, QGIS is highly popular among users who prefer open-source. It offers a  set of features for mapping and spatial analysis. Its compatibility with various file formats and extensible nature through plugins makes it a versatile choice.\n",
    "- **Google Earth Engine**: An advanced cloud-based tool for planetary-scale environmental data analysis. It's known for its massive archive of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets, which are useful for large-scale environmental monitoring and analysis.\n",
    "- **....**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools vary widely in functionality, complexity, and cost, catering to different needs and skill levels. In this notebook we will find that there are modules, thus tools, in Python that can perform the aforementioned GIS functionality of layering through to spatial analysis. However we need to add new formal defintions to the core of GIS, the underlying data, before we begin. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Raster and Vector Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial data primarily comes in two forms: **raster** and **vector** data. Understanding their differences, applications, and formats is important in the field. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/loftytopping/DEES_programming_course/blob/master/images/featured3.png?raw=true) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raster Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster data represents the Earth's surface as a matrix of cells, with each cell holding a value to represent a certain attribute like temperature or elevation. You can think of this as a checkerboard placed over the ground, where there is a value in each cell of the board. This may represent any variable of interest such as temperature, soil moisture, height and so on. The left hand side of figure 1 illustrates this concept. We can imagine opening a raster dataset in a wide range of software products, including Excel if we really wanted to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector data uses geometric shapes (points, lines, polygons) to represent spatial features like locations (wells, weather stations), paths (rivers, roads), and areas (lakes, political boundaries). We have already encoutered points in the previous notebook. Coordinates of single locations as a function of time resemble a raster dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics and examples of both **raster** and **vector** data are given in the table below. You can also find common formats used for storing the data. That isnt to say we will stop using CSV files. However, we quickly find that CSV files are rather limited when we start to work with data that is more complex than tabular structures. CSV files are also relatively inefficient so larger quantities of data require bespoke formats. We have already noted that Pandas can work with a wide range of data formats. For example, JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to open a GEOJSON file in a text editor you might find something similar to the following example containing a single point feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n",
    "  \"features\": [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"type\": \"Feature\",\n",
    "      \"geometry\": {\n",
    "        \"type\": \"Point\",\n",
    "        \"coordinates\": [-73.9617, 40.6629]\n",
    "      },\n",
    "      \"properties\": {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"Brooklyn\",\n",
    "        \"borough\": \"Kings\",\n",
    "        \"state\": \"NY\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the GeoJSON object is a FeatureCollection. It contains an array of Feature objects. Each Feature has a geometry (in this case, a Point with coordinates) and properties (additional data about the feature). GeoJSON introduces specific types such as Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection. Each of these types is used to represent different types of geographical features. We will be working with SHP files [see table below - Shapefiles] in this notebook. I cant actually provide you with an example of a SHP file per the GeoJOSN file. Shapefiles consist of several files that work together, and they contain binary data which is not human-readable in the same way.  They are however much more efficient in terms of storage requirements. The Shapefile format, commonly known as .shp, was created by Esri (Environmental Systems Research Institute), a leading company in the field of geographic information systems (GIS). Esri developed the Shapefile format in the early 1990s for their GIS software, and it quickly became a popular format for storing geographical data due to its simplicity and ease of use. \n",

That would be classed as *point vector* data since it was not provided under a fixed grid, but rather a set of latitude and longitude values for each eruption. In this notebook we will also work with polygon and line vector data. Choosing between raster and vector data depends on the data's nature and the analysis requirements. \n",

    "\n",
    "A slight *tweak* to Pandas is required to deal with line and polygon vector data. The good news is that someone has already done this for us. A module called GeoPandas is built exactly to deal with line and polygon data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is GeoPandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoPandas is an open-source project that makes working with geospatial data in Python easier. It extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. Geometric operations are performed by `shapely`. GeoPandas further depends on `fiona` for file access and `matplotlib` for plotting. These are all modules that are installed when we install GeoPandas using the `conda` package manager. Figure xx below provides a simple illustration of GeoPandas. Features of GeoPandas include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geospatial Data Handling**: Simplifies handling of geospatial data (like shapefiles, GeoJSON) in Python.\n",
    "- **Integration with pandas**: Builds upon and extends pandas, making it easy to work with geospatial data using familiar pandas functionalities.\n",
    "- **Geometry Operations**: Enables geometry operations (like calculating area, distance, buffering) directly on GeoDataFrame.\n",
    "- **Plotting and Visualization**: Offers straightforward plotting of geospatial data, which integrates well with `matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GeoDataFrame is the core data structure in GeoPandas, which can store geometry columns and perform spatial operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/loftytopping/DEES_programming_course/blob/master/images/geopandas.png?raw=true) \n",
    "\n",
    "notice how we still retain the concept of an index, but have a seperate column that can store shapes. We will load a `.shp` file that contains information on bedrock geology across the UK. First we will import relevant modules that we will use across this notebook. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - GeoPandas\n",
    " - Contextily [a small Python 3 (3.7 and above) package to retrieve tile maps from the internet](https://contextily.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It can add those tiles as a basemap to matplotlib figures, which gives us the underlying map.\n",
    " - Matplotlib. As usual...this deals with all of our plotting requirements."

If you take a look at the column `geometry` we can clearly see these do not represent latitude and longitude numbers. But why? A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) defines how the two-dimensional, projected map in your GeoDataFrame relates to real places on the earth. CRS can be represented in various formats, such as EPSG codes. EPSG codes are short identifiers assigned to coordinate reference system (CRS) definitions. These codes are standardized and maintained by the EPSG (European Petroleum Survey Group) Geodetic Parameter Dataset. EPSG codes cover both geographic coordinate systems (GCS) and projected coordinate systems (PCS).
